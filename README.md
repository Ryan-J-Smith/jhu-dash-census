Selected census datasets and scripts for getting more data

## Project as it stands:

The current project has **two** goals

### Aggregating demographics of data points

Given a set of data points corresponding to physical locations (e.g. address or latitude and longitude), we would like to construct a summary demographic.

Example: 

### Comparing demographics to census tracts

Given a particular demographic description, can we identify census divisions that have similar properties.

As an example, if we are interested in an outreach program to target low-income senior citizens, which census regions should be targeted?

## Challenges:

How do we compare different census regions?

## Current goals:

* Upload scripts for getting census data

* Upload a sample of data to begin working with

* Identify relevant census variables that make for meaningful comparisons (e.g. income, age, level of education)
